# Assembly: Endgame 🎮

This project is a creative spin on the classic Hangman game, titled "Assembly: Endgame," built using React. This game challenges players to guess words correctly to prevent various programming languages from being obliterated by the dominant Assembly language. While the concept might be playful, it serves as a meaningful step in my learning journey, showcasing my growing knowledge of React fundamentals. 🌱

## Demo
**Link:** [Play Assembly: Endgame](https://assembly-endgame-nine.vercel.app/)

## ✨ Features
- Engage in a hangman-style word guessing game where each mistake could cost a programming language its existence.
- Dynamic UI updates provide real-time feedback on game progress and outcomes.
- Celebrate victories with a vibrant confetti animation that fills the screen upon winning.

## 🛠️ Built With
- **React**: Utilized for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **clsx**: Used for conditional class name binding.

## 📚 React Knowledge Demonstrated
- **useState**: Manages the state of the game, including word selection, guesses, and game status.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Dynamically updates UI elements based on game state, enhancing player engagement and experience.

## 🚀 How It Works
- **Game Initialization**: At the start, the game generates a random word from a predefined list.
- **Guessing Mechanics**: Players select letters to guess the word; incorrect guesses contribute to the potential 'loss' of a programming language.
- **Game Outcome**: The game concludes either when the player guesses the word correctly or exhausts the allowed incorrect guesses, resulting in a loss where Assembly becomes dominant.
